# Update compare to its newest release, then re-run the installer.

# "Newest" is whatever the release lookup below reports; a draft or a
# pre-release is never offered, no matter how its version number sorts. This
# downloads that release's compare.tar.gz asset and extracts it over this
# directory, so it works the same whether you installed from a downloaded
# tarball or a git clone — no git required.
#
#   ./update.sh            check, ask, upgrade, reinstall
#   ./update.sh --check    report what is available and stop
#   ./update.sh --yes      no prompts (the reinstall inherits this)
#
# Any other options are passed straight through to install.sh, so
# `./update.sh --link` upgrades a symlinked development install.
#
# Needs `curl` and `tar`.

# --- release lookup: versions.txt on the versions branch ---------------------
# new-package.sh inserts this for a package in a monorepo. There,
# /releases/latest returns whichever package released last, so the repo's
# release workflow keeps one line per package — "<name> <version>" — in
# versions.txt on the versions branch. It writes a package's line only after
# that release's tarball is uploaded, and never for a pre-release, so the file
# never names a version that cannot be downloaded.
#
# release_lookup sets tag, latest and rel_url, or returns 1 with the reason in
# lookup_error. It runs curl as "${CURL[@]}", so a caller can wrap it in
# `timeout`. VERSIONS_URL can be overridden, which is how tests run it against
# a local file.
