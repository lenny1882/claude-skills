# Optional. Run by the release workflow at the tag, in this directory, with $1
# the version, before the tarball is packed. Each path in BUILD_OUTPUTS is then
# added to the tarball — for files that are generated, not committed. Non-zero
# stops the release.

# Optional, both. Changes outside $HOME around a real install. pre_install
# runs before any file is placed — stop services running from the package's
# directory, which a reinstall deletes and copies again; non-zero stops the
# install with nothing placed. post_install runs after the files and settings,
# before verify_probe; non-zero fails the install. Each gets $1: "install" the
# first time, "reinstall" when the package's files were already there. Neither
# runs on --dry-run or when KIT_SKIP_MACHINE_HOOKS=1 (the tests set it). Both
# must be safe to run again.

# post_install() {

# }

# Optional. Runs when install.sh stops after pre_install has run, with $1 the
# mode and $2 the reason, so services pre_install stopped are not left down.
# Skipped when KIT_SKIP_MACHINE_HOOKS=1.

# }

# Optional, both. Run by update.sh with $1 the installed version and $2 the
# new one, from the new release's manifest.sh. pre_update runs before the new
# files are unpacked; non-zero stops the update with nothing changed.
# post_update runs after install.sh succeeds; use it to migrate from an older
# version. Skipped with --dry-run and when KIT_SKIP_MACHINE_HOOKS=1.

# }

# Optional. Run by lib/update-check.sh check, in the background, once for each
# newly found release, with $1 the installed version, $2 the new one and $3 the
# release URL. It cannot show anything in a session; output goes to
# ~/.local/state/repo-remote-control-session/update_available.log. Skipped when

# Optional. Run in the background at session start when Claude Code's version
# has changed since last time, with $1 the old version and $2 the new one.
# Output goes to ~/.local/state/repo-remote-control-session/claude_updated.log. Skipped when

# UPDATE_NOTICE=0

# Optional. Runs in uninstall.sh before anything is removed, while the files
# are still installed: stop services started from the package's directory.
# Non-zero stops the uninstall with nothing removed. Skipped when
# KIT_SKIP_MACHINE_HOOKS=1 (the tests set it).
# pre_uninstall() {
#   systemctl --user stop "$PKG.service" 2>/dev/null || true
# }

# Optional. Runs in uninstall.sh after everything is removed, to undo a change
# outside $HOME that needs none of the package's files. Skipped when
# KIT_SKIP_MACHINE_HOOKS=1. Non-zero is reported; nothing is put back.
# post_uninstall() {
