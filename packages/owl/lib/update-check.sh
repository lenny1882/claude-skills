# Daily release check for owl.
#
# Asks the release lookup below what the newest release is, compares it
# against the version recorded at install time, and writes the answer to a
# state file. It never fetches, never touches the install directory, and never
# installs anything — upgrading is always an explicit `./update.sh`.
#
# A release left as a draft or marked pre-release is never reported, no
# matter how its version number sorts. update.sh downloads that release's
# owl.tar.gz asset directly — no git involved, so this works the same
# whether the install came from a git clone or a downloaded tarball.
#
# The check runs at most once per calendar day. Callers should run it in the
# background: a remote that is unreachable, slow, or asking for credentials
# must never hold up a session. `curl` is invoked under `timeout` for exactly
# that reason, and the day stamp is written even when the check fails, so an
# offline machine tries once a day rather than every session.
#
# Needs `curl`.
#
# A package's manifest.sh can define update_available, which check runs once
# for each newly found release, with the installed version, the new one and
# the release URL. See do_check. It can also define claude_updated, which
# claude-check runs when Claude Code's version has changed. See claude_check.
#
# Everything a caller displays comes from the *previous* run's state file. That
# is deliberate: reading a file is instant, whereas waiting on the network is
# not, so the notice you see is at most a day stale and costs nothing to show.
#
#   check [--force]   run today's check if it has not run; silent; ~0.5s
#   badge             "<glyph> vX.Y.Z" if an update is waiting, else nothing
#   notice            two-line plain-text notice, else nothing
#   hook-json         {"systemMessage": "..."} for a hook to emit, else nothing
#   session-start     hook-json, then today's check and claude-check in the
#                     background; what install.sh registers on SessionStart
#   claude-check      run claude_updated if Claude Code's version changed
#   status            installed / available / last checked
#   record-install <version> <repo-dir>    called by install.sh
#   clear             forget what the last check found

# --- release lookup: versions.txt on the versions branch ---------------------
# new-package.sh inserts this for a package in a monorepo. There,
# /releases/latest returns whichever package released last, so the repo's
# release workflow keeps one line per package — "<name> <version>" — in
# versions.txt on the versions branch. It writes a package's line only after
# that release's tarball is uploaded, and never for a pre-release, so the file
# never names a version that cannot be downloaded.
#
# release_lookup sets tag, latest and rel_url, or returns 1 with the reason in
# lookup_error. It runs curl as "${CURL[@]}", so a caller can wrap it in
# `timeout`. VERSIONS_URL can be overridden, which is how tests run it against
# a local file.
